# Hey! I'm r0mankeys 👋🏿

#### I am a relativley new self taught programmer who loves to learn through building projects

---

* 💻 My current main focus is learning computer architecture and systems porgramming because I find it to be the most fascinating field, for example:
    * Building Computers
    * Creating operating systems
    * Creating game and physics engines
    * Computational science
    * Artificial intelligence
    * Machine learning

* 🥷🏿 I am very interested in web-secuirty and ethical hacking (mainly because of media like movies and tv-shows like "MR ROBOT" but the science is also intriguing)

* 🕹 I am interested in game development because I have always loved playing games, from 2D platformers like "Super Mario Bros" and "Celeste" to AAA games like "The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild"

* 🤖 I am less so interested in font-end web development but I still do enjoy creating web-pages and practcing my skills, however the back-end is much more appealing
